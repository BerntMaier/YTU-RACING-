# YTU-RACING-
Hello everyone! In this article, we will talk about the aluminum Voltage 
Indicator PCB we designed for our electric vehicle YTR08E by YTU Racing in 
the Formula Student competition, the world's most prestigious undergraduate 
engineering competition, attended by university students from all over the world 
who are interested in motor racing.

**About the Current Sensor Booster;**
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BerntMaier/YTU-RACING-/main/opamp%20pcb.JPG)

 The current sensor booster circuit is a citcuit that helps to stabilising sensor 
output voltage for analog circuits which works with sensitive signal. It is easly 
made with 2 opamps. Buffer mode and non inverting amplifiers. The buffer 
mode is made by connecting the inverting pin to output. With that way,opamp 
will directly outputs the same input voltage. After that it connects directly to non 
inveting amplifier.Non inverting amplifier x allows us to subtract the voltage 
range we want .With that way we can get stabilised and filterd output voltage for 
our circuits.

This design is sponsored by JLCPCB. After designing the circuit however you 
want, you can order your PCB and get it to your hand in a short time! We would 
like to thank JLCPCB for their support and we are very satisfied with the service 
we received. First, you have to export GERBER and NC files of your PCB files. 
JLCPCB explained how to do it you can visit the website. They communicate 
very quickly in the format of the PCB gerber file or in case determination that 
may cause any problems in terms of production and they deliver the PCB 
without any problems. After that put the files into single rar file then get to the 
order page You are even able to change PCB color for free. You can change the 
shipping method. JLCPCB ensures the delivery PCB to your hand for 3 days! 
You can check the website of JLCPCB. We want to thank again to JLCPCB for 
the great quality of its service.

JLCPCB SMT Parts Library has 200k+ in-stock components (689 Basic 
components and 200k+ Extended components)
You can build your library Inventory, save parts for now or in the future 
Assembly which will be supported with 10M+ parts by Digikey, mouser, This 
benefits customers to source components much faster and easier, bringing you a 
shorter PCBA production time You can Get PCBA products in one week, from 
ordering, parts sourcing, and PCBA prototyping Your PCBs are passing 
JLCPCB’s special tests such as inspection in JLCPCB’s high-tech facility and 
visual tests, X-ray test is used to check the quality of the solder joints (such as 
BGA) under the components on the line to ensure that the circuit board can 
achieve 100% test coverage, solder paste inspections, SPI which is checking in 
advance whether there is a lack of poor solder paste printing, AOI, the surface of 
the object can be checked correctly (but for objects hidden under the part or on 
the edge of the part) The solder joints may be out of reach) You can get your 
PCB soldered in many different ways such as hand-soldering, reflow soldering, 
and wave soldering. Your PCBs are produced on a first-class production line 
adopted with an advanced Yamaha automatic placement machine all those 
machines are equipped electric feeder, a 10 temperature zone lead-free reflow 
soldering, automatic printing machine. SMT production line has functioned such 
as sorting, rectification, cleaning, literacy, and production line discipline 
management.
Thank you, JLCPCB
